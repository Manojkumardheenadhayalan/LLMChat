      "The Apple Vision Pro AR and VR headset is a reality\n",
      "After years of rumors, leaks, and speculation, Apple has finally unveiled the Vision Pro, its first AR and VR headset.\n",
      "-Mixed reality headset\n",
      "-Dual M2 and R1 chip setup\n",
      "-4K resolution per eye\n",
      "-No controllers, uses hand tracking and voice inputs\n",
      "-External battery pack\n",
      "-Two-hour battery life\n",
      "-Starts at $3,499 (around £2,800 / AU$5,300)\n",
      "-Runs on visionOS\n",
      "The announcement came as the 'One more thing' of Apple's WWDC 2023 event, at which it also unveiled a new 15-inch MacBook Air, new features coming with iOS 17, and a new M2 Ultra processor, among other reveals.\n",
      "Many of the leaks we'd heard proved to be correct, although a fair few weren't 100% accurate. So even if you've been following along for the past few months years we'd recommend reading on to get caught up on all the official info. Below you'll find all of the official details about the Apple Vision Pro VR headset, including its price, specs, design, and the vague release date Apple has provided.\n",
      "Vision Pro release date: Sometime \"early next year\" according to Apple.\n",
      "Vision Pro headset price: Starts at $3,499 (around £2,800 / AU$5,300).\n",
      "Vision Pro headset specs: Apple's headset uses two chipsets, an M2 and a new R1 to handle regular software and its XR capabilities respectively. It also has dual 4K displays.\n",
      "Vision Pro headset design: The Vision Pro has a similar design to other VR headsets, with a front panel that covers your eyes, and an elastic strap. One change from the norm is that it has an outer display to show the wearer's eyes.\n",
      "Vision Pro headset battery life: It lasts for up to two hours on a full charge using the official external battery pack.\n",
      "Vision Pro headset controllers: There are no controllers – instead you'll use your eyes, hands, and voice to control its visionOS software.\n",
      "Apple says the Vision Pro will \"start\" at $3,499 (that's around £2,800 / AU$5,300). That wording suggests that more expensive options will be available, but right now we don't know what those higher-priced headsets might offer over the standard model.\n",
      "As for release date for the Vision Pro, Apple has only given a vague “early next year.” That's later than we'd been expecting, with leaks suggesting it would launch in the next few months – perhaps around the same time as the iPhone 15 – but that isn't the case. As 2024 gets closer we expect Apple will give us an update on when we'll be able to strap a Vision Pro onto our heads.\n",
      "Interestingly, Apple's website only mentions a US release. Apple has yet to confirm if the Vision Pro will launch in regions outside of the US, and when that'll happen.\n",
      "The Apple Vision shares a lot of similarities with the current crop of best VR headsets. It has a large face panel that covers your eyes, and is secured to your head with a strap made from elasticated fabric, plastic and padding.\n",
      "But rather than the similarities, let's focus on the Vision Pro's unique design features.\n",
      "The biggest difference VR veterans will notice is that the Vision Pro doesn't have a battery; instead, it relies on an external battery pack. This is a sort of evolution of the HTC Vive XR Elite's design, which allowed the headset to go from being a headset with a battery in its strap to a battery-less pair of glasses that relies on external power.\n",
      "\n",
      "This battery pack will provide roughly two hours of use on a full charge according to Apple, and is small enough to fit in the wearer's pocket. It'll connect to the headset via a cable, which is a tad unseemly by Apple’s usual design standards, but what this choice lacks in style it should make up for in comfort. We found the Meta Quest Pro to be really comfy, but wearing it for extended periods of time can put a strain on your neck – just ask our writer who wore the Quest Pro for work for a whole week.\n",
      "If you buy a Vision Pro you'll find that your box lacks something needed for other VR headsets: controllers. That's because the Vision Pro relies solely on tracking your hand and eye movements, as well as voice inputs, to control its apps and experiences. It'll pick up these inputs using its array of 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones.\n",
      "The last design detail of note is the Vision Pro's Eyesight display. It looks pretty odd, maybe even a bit creepy, but we're reserving judgment until we've had a chance to try it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a Vision Pro wearer is using AR features and can see the real world, nearby people will see\n",

      "The last design detail of note is the Vision Pro's Eyesight display. It looks pretty odd, maybe even a bit creepy, but we're reserving judgment until we've had a chance to try it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a Vision Pro wearer is using AR features and can see the real world, nearby people will see their eyes 'through' the headset's front panel (it's actually a screen showing a camera view of the eyes, but based on Apple's images you might be convinced it's a simple plane of glass). If they're fully immersed in an experience, onlookers will instead see a cloud of color to signify that they're exploring another world.\n",
      "As the rumors had suggested, the Apple Vision Pro headset will come with some impressive specs to justify its sky-high price.\n",
      "First, the Vision Pro will use two chipsets to power its experiences. One is an M2 chip, the same one you'll find in the Apple iPad Pro (2022), and some of the best MacBooks and Macs. This powerful processor will handle the apps and software you're running on the Vision Pro. Meanwhile, the R1 chipset will deal with the mixed reality side of things, processing the immersive elements of the Vision Pro that turn it from a glorified wearable Mac display to an immersive \"spatial computer\".\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of these chips, the Vision Pro has crisp 4K micro-OLED displays – one per eye – that offer roughly 23 million pixels each. According to Apple the Vision Pro's display fits 64 pixels into the same space that the iPhone's screen fits one single pixel, and this could eliminate the annoying screen-door effect that affects other VR headsets. This effect occurs when you're up close to a screen and you can start to see the gaps between the pixels in the array; the higher the pixel density, the closer you can get before the screen door effect becomes noticeable.\n",
      "These components will allow you to run an array of Apple software through Apple's new visionOS platform (not xrOS as was rumored). This includes immersive photos and videos, custom-made Disney Plus experiences, and productivity apps like Keynote.\n",
      "You'll also be able to play over 100 Apple Arcade titles on a virtual screen that's like your own private movie theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll be able to connect your Vision Pro headset to a Mac via Bluetooth. When using this feature you'll be able to access your Mac apps and see your screen on a large immersive display, and it'll sit alongside other Vision Pro apps you're using. Apple says this setup will help you be more productive than you've ever been.\n",
      "With the power of the M2 chip, Apple's headset should be able to run most Mac apps natively – Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro recently arrived on M2 iPads. For now, however, Apple hasn't revealed if these and other apps will be available natively on the Vision Pro, or if you'll need a Mac to unlock the headset's full potential. We expect these details will be revealed nearer to the headset's 2024 launch.\n",

      "Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the new headset \"seamlessly blends the real world and the virtual world\".\n",
      "The tech firm also announced its latest iPhone operating system, as well as updates to MacBook Air.\n",
      "The headset has a two-hour battery life, costs $3,499 (£2,849) and will be released early next year in the US.\n",
      "The cost is considerably higher than virtual reality headsets currently on the market. Last week Meta announced its Quest 3 - which costs $499.\n",
      "Apple said little about generative artificial intelligence - the buzzy technology that is the talk of Silicon Valley.\n",
      "The company's share price fell slightly during the announcement, made at a developer's conference at Apple Park, the company's headquarters, in Cupertino, California.\n",
      "The BBC was among the media outlets at the event, and technology editor Zoe Kleinman was one of the first people in the world to try out the headset.\n",
      "\"Since current boss Tim Cook took over in 2011, with the possible exception of the Watch, Apple has been unable to come up with the kind of world-changing product of the past,\" she said.\n",
      "\"Have they done it here?\"\n",
      "Apple Vision Pro looks different to similar headsets on the market - and is more reminiscent of a pair of ski goggles than a virtual reality headset.\n",
      "Apple used the phrase \"augmented reality\" to describe what the new device does.\n",
      "Augmented reality, also known as mixed reality, superimposes virtual objects in the world around us - enabling us to mix reality with virtual reality by looking through a screen.\n",
      "\"It's like your phone but right in front of you - big, bright and bold, wherever you are,\" Ms Kleinman said.\n",
      "In letting you do things like watch videos of your family blowing out birthday candles or immerse yourself in your photography by making your panoramic photos life-size, she says it is pitched as a device which is \"very much about being part of your daily life\", unlike many other headsets on the market geared primarily towards immersive gaming.\n",
      "Users can access apps, watch movies, and write documents in a virtual world. But so far, there is little evidence of a big market for this kind of wearable tech.\n",
      "\"It's still at the end of the day a VR headset,\" said Ms Kleinman. \"Apple is going to have to have an awful lot of content to throw at this when it ships early next year.\n",
      "\"And of course the other thing is the price point - $3,499 is a lot of money.\"\n",
      "Hartley Charlton, senior editor of MacRumors, was unsure how much the headset would appeal to the general public.\n",
      "\"It won't appeal to mainstream consumers at first on account of its extremely high price point and immediate shortcomings as a first-generation device, such as its separate wired battery pack,\" he said.\n",
      "But he said Apple has a track record of \"overcoming scepticism\" about new devices, and has historically encouraged people to \"part with their cash to add a new gadget to their repertoire\".\n",
      "In his sales pitch, Mr Cook said the headset allows users to \"see, hear and interact with digital content just like it's in your physical space\".\n",
      "It is controlled by using a combination of your hands, eyes and voice - such as tapping your fingers together to select, and flicking them to scroll.\n",
      "The announcement comes a week after Meta and Lenovo announced new iterations of their pre-existing virtual reality headsets, that do not superimpose objects on to a view of the real world.\n",
      "Meta has also invested heavily in mixed reality - but right now the sector is struggling.\n",
      "The headset market saw a 54% drop in global sales last year, according to the International Data Corporation.\n",
      "Apple's last major hardware release was for the Apple Watch device in 2015.\n",
      "Thomas Husson, of Forrester Research, told BBC News it may take time for Apple's new headset to take off.\n",
      "\"The overall AR/VR space has been a bit overhyped over the past few years with the metaverse and that kind of experience,\" he said. \"That's the reason why I think it will take a bit more time.\n",
      "\"Having said that, if I told you 10 to 15 years ago that people would be ready to pay almost $2,000 for a mobile phone, I don't think many people would have said they would be willing to pay that.\"\n",
      "Aside from the Vision Pro announcement, Apple also unveiled iOS17, the latest version of its iPhone operating system.\n",
      "Updates include \"contact posters\" - a picture or image of yourself that will appear on a person's phone when you call them - and \"live voicemail\" - which provides a real-time transcription of an answerphone message being left to you.\n",
      "This transcription will also apply to audio messages left using Apple Messages.\n",
      "And Apple has introduced a system called Check-In - which will automatically tell a friend or family member when you have arrived home.\n",

      "Apple has announced an augmented reality headset called Apple Vision Pro that “seamlessly” blends the real and digital world. “It’s the first Apple product you look through, and not at,” CEO Tim Cook said of the device, which looks like a pair of ski goggles. As rumored, it features a separate battery pack and is controlled with eyes, hands, and voice. It will start at $3,499 and launch early next year, starting in the US market with more countries coming later in the year.\n",
      "Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial.\n",
      "The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, you can also give voice commands, and Apple says “hundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps” will automatically work that way. On top of that, the headset supports Bluetooth accessories, including Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, and lets you connect your Mac to use inside the headset. Downward-facing cameras can capture your hands even if they’re resting low on your body.\n",
      "You can see these, as well as loads of other details, in our 180-plus image gallery below:\n",
      "1/189\n",
      "1/189\n",
      "The headset has a glass front and an aluminum frame, containing five sensors, 12 cameras, a 4K display for each eye, and a computer that’s apparently cooled with a fan. The headset mask (which Apple dubs a “Light Seal”) and strap (which Apple dubs a “Head Band”) are cloth-lined and modular, and Apple says they can flex to fit to a variety of face shapes and head sizes. The Head Band is ribbed and fits around the back of your head, and you can swap different sizes and styles of band.\n",
      "Zeiss has created custom optical inserts that magnetically attach to the lenses for people who wear glasses. It has an external battery that lasts up to two hours and can connect via a “supple woven cable” so it slips into a pocket, or you can plug it into external power and use it all day. Apple promises that the display will be unprecedentedly sharp and can deliver 4K video.\n",
      "The system uses an M2, but it also includes a new chip called the R1.\n",
      "You’re also not, Apple promises, isolated from people around you. The headset will display your eyes with a system called EyeSight, and if you’re in full VR, a glowing screen will obscure them to suggest you’re not available. It also creates a digital “persona” — basically a hyperrealistic avatar — by scanning your face. The device uses passthrough video that lets you see the real world in full color, but you can project 3D objects into real space, including pulling objects out of a message thread into the real world.\n",
      "When you’re talking to people remotely, you can use spatial audio to do things like arrange FaceTime participants as “video tiles” around the room. And you can capture and “relive” 180-degree video with a 3D camera while inside the headset. Apple is also touting TV and Arcade content on the headset, including premium content from Disney.\n",
      "The headset has been in the works for years and has reportedly gone through several iterations as well as years of delays. It’s meant to be CEO Tim Cook’s signature addition to the Apple product lineup, and it’s garnered praise from industry insiders, even though it will enter a market that hasn’t taken off. Its primary competitor will likely be Meta, which has enjoyed relative success with its games-focused Quest 2 headset and gotten a more mixed reception to its general-purpose Quest Pro.\n",

      "PRESS RELEASE\n",
      "Introducing Apple Vision Pro: Apple’s first spatial computer\n",
      "CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today unveiled Apple Vision Pro, a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others. Vision Pro creates an infinite canvas for apps that scales beyond the boundaries of a traditional display and introduces a fully three-dimensional user interface controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — a user’s eyes, hands, and voice. Featuring visionOS, the world’s first spatial operating system, Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in a way that feels like it is physically present in their space. The breakthrough design of Vision Pro features an ultra-high-resolution display system that packs 23 million pixels across two displays, and custom Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design to ensure every experience feels like it’s taking place in front of the user’s eyes in real time.\n",
      "“Today marks the beginning of a new era for computing,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Just as the Mac introduced us to personal computing, and iPhone introduced us to mobile computing, Apple Vision Pro introduces us to spatial computing. Built upon decades of Apple innovation, Vision Pro is years ahead and unlike anything created before — with a revolutionary new input system and thousands of groundbreaking innovations. It unlocks incredible experiences for our users and exciting new opportunities for our developers.”\n",
      "“Creating our first spatial computer required invention across nearly every facet of the system,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of the Technology Development Group. “Through a tight integration of hardware and software, we designed a standalone spatial computer in a compact wearable form factor that is the most advanced personal electronics device ever.”\n",
      "Extraordinary New Experiences\n",
      "Apple Vision Pro brings a new dimension to powerful, personal computing by changing the way users interact with their favorite apps, capture and relive memories, enjoy stunning TV shows and movies, and connect with others in FaceTime.\n",
      "An infinite canvas for apps at work and at home: visionOS features a three-dimensional interface that frees apps from the boundaries of a display so they can appear side by side at any scale. Apple Vision Pro enables users to be even more productive, with infinite screen real estate, access to their favorite apps, and all-new ways to multitask. And with support for Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, users can set up the perfect workspace or bring the powerful capabilities of their Mac into Vision Pro wirelessly, creating an enormous, private, and portable 4K display with incredibly crisp text.\n",
      "Engaging entertainment experiences: With two ultra-high-resolution displays, Apple Vision Pro can transform any space into a personal movie theater with a screen that feels 100 feet wide and an advanced Spatial Audio system. Users can watch movies and TV shows, or enjoy stunning three-dimensional movies. Apple Immersive Video offers 180-degree high-resolution recordings with Spatial Audio, and users can access an exciting lineup of immersive videos that transport them to entirely new places.\n",
      "Spatial computing makes new types of games possible with titles that can span a spectrum of immersion and bring gamers into all-new worlds. Users can also play over 100 Apple Arcade games on a screen as large as they want, with incredible immersive audio and support for popular game controllers.\n",
      "Immersive Environments: With Environments, a user’s world can grow beyond the dimensions of a physical room with dynamic, beautiful landscapes that can help them focus or reduce clutter in busy spaces. A twist of the Digital Crown lets a user control how present or immersed they are in an environment.\n",
      "Memories come alive: Featuring Apple’s first three-dimensional camera, Apple Vision Pro lets users capture, relive, and immerse themselves in favorite memories with Spatial Audio. Every spatial photo and video transports users back to a moment in time, like a celebration with friends or a special family gathering. Users can access their entire photo library on iCloud, and view their photos and videos at a life-size scale with brilliant color and spectacular detail. Every Panorama shot on iPhone expands and wraps around the user, creating the sensation they are standing right where it was taken.\n",
      "FaceTime becomes spatial: With Apple Vision Pro, FaceTime calls take advantage of the room around the user, with everyone on the call reflected in life-size tiles, as well as Spatial Audio, so it sounds as if participants are speaking right from where they are positioned. Users wearing Vision Pro during a FaceTime call are reflected as a Persona — a digital representation of themselves created using Apple’s most advanced machine learning techniques — which reflects face and hand movements in real time. Users can do things together like watch a movie, browse photos, or collaborate on a presentation.\n",
      "Even more app experiences: Apple Vision Pro has an all-new App Store where users can discover apps and content from developers, and access hundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps that run great and automatically work with the new input system for Vision Pro. Apple’s developer community can go even further and take advantage of the powerful and unique capabilities\n",
